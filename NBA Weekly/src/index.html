        <h3>Kevin Durant stars as Team USA claim fourth straight Olympic gold medal</h3>
        <small>Posted by Ronnel Salgado on July 14</small>
        <p>
            The Americans expected nothing less. And in the end, their Olympic reign continues.

            Kevin Durant scored 29 points and joined Carmelo Anthony as the only three-time men's gold medallists in Olympic basketball history after the U.S. held off France 87-82 on Saturday morning in Saitama, ending a summer that started with sputters but closed with celebration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Durant sealed it by knocking down two free throws with 8.8 seconds left, making the outcome academic. The lead was five, France's final possession was irrelevant, and it was over. The U.S. players gathered for a hug at midcourt, Durant, Bam Adebayo and Draymond Green wrapped themselves in American flags, and the journey was complete.
